the purpose of this project was to create an inventory system for a grocery store, with the three main objectives being to:  
be able to pull the amount of a particular item
be able to pull the amount of all items
be able to pull total item amount in a histogram format
I believe I accomplished this task well as a whole but in particular I believe I excelled in, with use of my inline comments, making the instructions for use easy to understand for its intended users, those being grocery store employees. Now, some areas I believe I could improve would be in some Quality of Life features such as, for one, making it so the program didn't terminate after any given command, but also perhaps using header and class files to give the program some extra adaptibility in the case of needed modification.
in terms of transfer, being able to input and modify text files could come in handy for a variety of projects, mostly inventory but I can see some use in say, a calculator program or similar, or perhaps statistics in the case of a histogram. 
In terms of maintainability and adaptability, while in the latter not so much as i stated previously but in terms of the former, as i stated in the file itself the brunt of maintaining and adapting the program is on part of the input given. Readability is by far its strongest stat, as I made sure to include lots of notes for potential users who might not be code literate. though perhaps another improvement could be adding instructions to the running program in the form of a command for bringing up help, or just in startup.
